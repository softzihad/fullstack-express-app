				<h2>Parrot uses smart speaker to order 240 garden gnomes</h2>
				<p>
					A man from Birmingham woke up to find 240 identical garden gnomes on his doorstep. Confused and mildly
					terrified, he initially suspected a prank—until he heard his pet parrot Rio calmly repeat the phrase “order
					more gnomes” in a voice eerily similar to his own. Upon checking his smart speaker’s purchase history, the
					mystery was solved: his chatty parrot had accidentally triggered a bulk order spree while the man was away at
					work.

					“I thought it was a glitch,” said Gary Blackbeard, “but then I remembered he’s obsessed with the word
					‘gnome’.” The incident has since gone viral, with neighbors taking selfies among the tiny bearded invaders.
					The man is now in discussions with local garden centers about a donation—or possibly opening the UK’s first
					gnome sanctuary.
